I'm still learning Python and using these as reference guides for any employment opportunities and future projects.

This is a simple MongoDB client I made for testing. The main use of this program is data entry with MongoDB as the database.

UI created in Qt Designer

Click on run.bat to run the program, the bat file will install pyside6, qdarkstyle and pymongo if they are not already installed on your system and start the application.

Tested with [MongoDB Cloud](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) and MongoDB on docker, radio button lets you select between the two.

Best Regards,<br/>
